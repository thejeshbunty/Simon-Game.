Simon Game

A fun, interactive memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The Simon Game challenges players to repeat a randomly generated sequence of colors and sounds, testing memory and focus. With each level, the sequence grows longer, making the game progressively harder.


🚀 Features

🎵 Sound effects for each button press

✨ Animations for visual feedback

🎯 Level progression as the sequence gets longer

❌ Game Over screen with restart option

🖱 Keyboard & mouse support for starting and playing


🛠 Technologies Used

HTML5 – Provides the structure of the game

CSS3 – Styling and animations

JavaScript (ES6) – Handles the logic, random sequence generation, and user validation

jQuery – Simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling

🎯 How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.


2. Watch carefully as the game flashes a sequence of colors with sounds.


3. Repeat the exact sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.


4. If correct ✅ → You move to the next level (with an even longer sequence).


5. If wrong ❌ → "Game Over" message appears, and you can restart by pressing any key.
